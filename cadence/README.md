## Contract Description
```javascript

  /*
    Description: Central Smart Contract for Chapter2 Bikes
    
    This smart contract contains the core functionality for 
    Chapter2 Bikes, created by Ethos Multiverse Inc.
    
    The contract manages the data associated with each NFT and 
    the distribution of each NFT to recipients.
    
    Admins throught their admin resource object have the power 
    to do all of the important actions in the smart contract such 
    as minting and batch minting.
    
    When NFTs are minted, they are initialized with a metadata object and an Edition type and then
    stored in the admins Collection.
    
    The contract also defines a Collection resource. This is an object that 
    every Chapter2 NFT owner will store in their account
    to manage their NFT collection.
    
    The main Chapter2 Bikes account operated by Ethos Multiverse Inc. 
    will also have its own Chapter2 collection it can use to hold its 
    own NFT's that have not yet been sent to a user.
    
    Note: All state changing functions will panic if an invalid argument is
    provided or one of its pre-conditions or post conditions aren't met.
    Functions that don't modify state will simply return 0 or nil 
    and those cases need to be handled by the caller.
